## 🚀 What is StrongGrid  

StrongGrid is a fast, secure, and privacy-first password generator web app that lets you generate complex and highly secure passwords instantly — directly in your browser, without server-side storage.  

---

## ✅ Key Features  

- **Secure & random** — uses cryptographic randomness (CSPRNG) to produce unpredictable, unique passwords that resist brute-force attacks.  
- **Customizable rules** — choose password length, include/exclude uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols; enable advanced settings.  
- **Pronounceable mode (optional)** — generate passwords that are secure **and** easier to remember.  
- **Real-time strength meter** — see password complexity immediately.  
- **One-click copy** — copy generated password with a single click.  
- **Local, browser-only storage** — password history stored temporarily in browser, with **no server storage** (privacy-first design).  
- **Offline capable** — once the page is loaded, you can generate passwords without an internet connection.  
- **Mobile-friendly & responsive design** — works well on desktops, tablets, and phones.

## 📄 Why Use StrongGrid  

- Weak or reused passwords are a leading cause of data breaches. A properly generated, high-entropy password — long, complex, and unique — makes brute-force or dictionary attacks impractical.
- StrongGrid allows you to generate such passwords instantly, with full control and no external dependencies or storage.  

---

## ⚠️ Security & Privacy Considerations  

- All password generation is done **locally in your browser**. **No password or user data is sent to any server.**  
- Browser-local password history (if used) is stored only temporarily and not transmitted elsewhere.  
- Always use different passwords for different accounts, and avoid re-using generated passwords across multiple services.
